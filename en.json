The application areas: IHU is particularly suitable for pipes with variable diameters and for producing copper fittings, especially T-pieces. Nowadays, aluminum tubes for bicycle frame manufacturing are often adapted and shaped geometrically using hydroforming. This allows for a reduction in wall thicknesses, reducing weight and costs. In body construction, hollow sheet metal parts are produced by welding two sheets together and then applying pressure. For example, step seams, partially with perforations, ensure the fulfillment of specific load requirements. In chassis construction, the production of parts is sometimes greatly simplified.",
